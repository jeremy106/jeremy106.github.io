        <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
        <p>Programming is just as much about problem-solving as it is about writing code. While some
           problems you might run into as a programmer are specific to coding (e.g. syntax errors), other
           situations call for the techniques that apply to any kind of problem you might face in everyday life.
           Here's a story about how I went about solving the problem of the broken dishwasher
        </p>
        <p>
          One evening after coming home from work, I encountered an error message from my wife: "The dishwasher 
          is broken". This was quite upsetting because the backup dishwasher was me. I wasn't keen to spend
          a bunch of money on a brand new machine so I took on the challenge of solving the problem myself.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first step I like to take when solving a problem is to clearly define the problem. Often this involves
          breaking the problem down into smaller issues and laying them out in order (a bit like writing <b>pseudocode</b>).
          "Dishwasher is broken" isn't a very useful error message so lets be a bit more specific. How about "The 
          drawers keep getting stuck". That's better, but can we get even more specific? "The wheels on the drawers
          are degraded and keep falling off". Now we're talking. The problem has been reduced from "Fix the dishwasher"
          to "Fix the wheels". Now we're ready for the next problem-solving step: <b>Try something</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing I tried was simply gluing the wheels back in place. I wasn't particularly hopeful and sure
          enough the glue failed after one wash and I was back to the drawing board but at least I had ruled out 
          something simple. My next step was to employ <b>Rubber Ducky</b> method. I asked my dog what she thought but before
          she could respond I said "man it would be great if you could just buy new wheels instead of a whole 
          dishwasher". In that moment my dog gave me a knowing look and I realised "wait a minute! maybe I can!". Cue 
          problem solving techniques four and five: <b>Read the manual</b>, and <b>ask Google</b>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          A quick search of the documentation and the internet gave me the part number for the wheels and the website for 
          a dishwasher parts supplier. A few days and a handful of dollars later the new parts showed up and I had 
          those drawers sliding perfectly. Problem solved! In this case I managed to figure it out myself, but sometimes
          the next step is to <b>ask for help</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was having a frustrating time trying to figure out what to write in this blog. I was initially 
          reluctant to ask for help since it seemed like such a simple problem to be stuck on. In the end I decided
          to be brave and hit up the homegroup chat. After explaining my situation I got a super simple but super helpful suggestion to think
          outside the coding space and I immediately recalled this rivetting dishwasher tale. I think next time 
          I'll feel less reluctant to reach out.
