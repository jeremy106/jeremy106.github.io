        <h1>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h1>
        <h2>Our brains can change</h2>
        <p>
          The brain is made up of billions of connected cells called Neurons and
          is one of the most complex objects in the known universe. All of our
          skills, traits, and memories exist in the brain as groups of related
          neurons firing together as a network. Neuroplasticity refers to the
          brains ability to change and adapt these networks as we grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the last few decades it has been shown that brains remain able to
          adapt beyond our childhood years and well into adulthood. Encouragingly,
          even simply knowing that this is the case has been shown to improve
          learning outcomes in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17328703/">
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">tightly controlled studies</span></a>.
          Knowing that your abilities can improve with practice can increase motivation, 
          which in turn can increase engagement and lead to a virtuous cycle of improvement.

        <p>
          There are many ways to promote neuroplasticity in adulthood but most boil down to
          stimulating your brain or getting out of your comfort zone. Some of my favourite ways
          to achieve this are by playing and learning new board games. This often involves understanding 
          some new concepts, testing my problem solving skills, and interacting with friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other important steps to take include being physically active (i.e. exercise) as well as getting
          high quality sleep. For more information check out this helpful article:
