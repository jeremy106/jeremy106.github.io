        <h3>
          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I think I already knew this about myself, but my ego is enormous. I found myself constantly thinking things like "I already know this..." or "this doesn't really apply to me..." and even as I type this I'm not convinced I was wrong. One thing I definitely learned was that the mental skills associated with high level sport transfer well into the programming domain. Things like mindfulness, values & identity, and growth mindset are all concepts that I have embraced during my career playing Underwater Hockey for New Zealand and so I had little trouble incorporating them into my coding practice. Another thing I that I have infered from the Human Skill curriculum is that learning must be much more stressful for others than it I find it. I am absolutely invigorated by learning something difficult and was surpised by how much emphasis was put on messaging like "don't worry if you find it hard/stressful, thats normal"
        </p>
        <h3>
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Learning and programming can both be frustrating at times, and require an ample supply of motivation. Understanding your values and your "why am I doing this" is a powerful way to fuel motivation and get through frustrating or difficult times. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Programming in the real world almost always involves co-operating with other developers, or managing relationships with stakeholders. In those situations, empathy and self-awareness are valuable traits to bring to the fore as they improve communication and help to resolve/prevent conflicts.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I worked for four years at a software company which had a strong 'people first' culture. I was surprised how much of the content of the Human Skills curriculum I recognised from my time at that company. 
        </p>
        <h3>
          What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
        </h3>
        <p>
          For me the most challenging aspect was patience. Something I'm trying to develop as a human is to let other people finish what they're saying or thinking before either speaking myself or just tuning out. 
        </p>
        <h3>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I suspect it is partly because these skills are genuinely valuable out in the professional world and partly as a key marketing value proposition to distinguish EDA from other courses. 
        </p>
        <h3>
          Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
        </h3>
        <p>
          I certainly looked forward to the tech material each week much more than the core material. Despite that I don't think studying Human skills has been a waste of time. The proportion of time spent doing human skills vs programming was about right. The professional world can definitely use more high EQ individuals so I'm on board for this type of curriculum. On a personal level, I'm still learning to engage with other people and seek feedback more often so this has been good practice.
