      <h1>Learning Plan</h1>

      <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        My plan is to find a job as a junior/intermediate developer and gain
        experience in a reasonably mature tech/SaaS company. Eventually I hope
        to come up with some ideas / products to develop personally both as a
        hobby and as a secondary source of income.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What are your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I am confident that I can learn and understand anything if I'm given the
        time to think it through. I struggle if information is dumped on me in
        no particular order or without structure and I don't like learning
        things before they are relevant to me. If I'm asked to do something
        myself and given some kind of starting point, I usually figure things
        out on my own pretty quickly.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
        in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I would like to get better at sharing my work/processes with other
        people and to seek feedback earlier and more often. I have a tendancy to
        isolate myself until I think everything is perfect before sharing my
        work with others.
      </p>

      <h2>How will you manage your workload in this programme?</h2>
      <p>
        I expect to have no issues managing my workload for this programme. I
        have no dependents and a supportive partner who is ready to leave me to
        my own devices as required over the coming weeks/months. I intend to
        strictly enforce some periods of 'downtime' in the late evenings and
        weekends to prevent myself from burning out.
      </p>
      <p>
        If things become stressful, I always know I can straighten things out by
        doing some exercise. I have years of elite sports experience to fall
        back on here.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I find myself stuck on something for more than an hour I intend to
        seek help from my Facilitator or a peer who I consider knowledgeable.
      </p>
      <h2>What do you expect from the Facilitation team?</h2>
      <p>
        The main thing I'm expecting from the Facilitation team is for feedback
        and encouragement to push myself. I aim for excellence in all things so
        I will not be upset to have mistakes pointed out or to be given
        suggestions on how I can make something even better.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Is there any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I hope to maintain a weekly hobby night that I host with some friends on
        Thursday evenings however I will be willing to give this up during
        bootcamp if the workload makes this untenable.
