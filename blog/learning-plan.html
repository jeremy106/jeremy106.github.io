        <h1>Learning Plan</h1>

        <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>
          My plan is to find a job as a junior/intermediate developer and gain
          experience in a reasonably mature tech/SaaS company. Eventually I hope
          to come up with some ideas / products to develop personally both as a
          hobby and as a secondary source of income.
        </p>

        <h2>
          What are your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I am confident that I can learn and understand anything if I'm given
          the time to think it through. I struggle if information is dumped on
          me in no particular order or without structure and I don't like
          learning things before they are relevant to me. If I'm asked to do
          something myself and given some kind of starting point, I usually
          figure things out on my own pretty quickly.
        </p>
        <h2>
          What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I would like to get better at sharing my work/processes with other
          people and to seek feedback earlier and more often. I have a tendancy
          to isolate myself until I think everything is perfect before sharing
          my work with others.
        </p>

        <h2>How will you manage your workload in this programme?</h2>
        <p>
          I expect to have no issues managing my workload for this programme. I
          have no dependents and a supportive partner who is ready to leave me
          to my own devices as required over the coming weeks/months. I intend
          to strictly enforce some periods of 'downtime' in the late evenings
          and weekends to prevent myself from burning out.
        </p>
        <p>
          If things become stressful, I always know I can straighten things out
          by doing some exercise. I have years of elite sports experience to
          fall back on here.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I find myself stuck on something for more than an hour I intend to
          seek help from my Facilitator or a peer who I consider knowledgeable.
        </p>
        <h2>What do you expect from the Facilitation team?</h2>
        <p>
          The main thing I'm expecting from the Facilitation team is for
          feedback and encouragement to push myself. I aim for excellence in all
          things so I will not be upset to have mistakes pointed out or to be
          given suggestions on how I can make something even better.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Is there any scheduling information such as block-out times when you
          are committed to other things?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I hope to maintain a weekly hobby night that I host with some friends
          on Thursday evenings however I will be willing to give this up during
          bootcamp if the workload makes this untenable.
