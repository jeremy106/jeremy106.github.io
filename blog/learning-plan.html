        <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
        <h2 class="orbitron borderBottom">Bootcamp</h2>
        <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>
          I hope to establish a career as a versatile and well-respected software developer. I'd like to work for a company with modern practices/principles that have some positive (according to me) impact on the world. Eventually, I like the idea of being able to develop my own product or run my own company/side hustle so that I have maximum control of my life.
        </p>
        <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
        <p>
          My biggest strengths will be my already well developed problem-solving skills and my ability to quickly learn new things. I have never had trouble learning a technical skill and I enjoy the process of figuring things out.
        </p>
        <p>
          My biggest limitation is motivational in nature. If I'm not given a goal or being challenged to do something, I am quite happy to stay where I am. This means if I get ahead of the material I might start to disengage. I'm hoping that bootcamp provides enough of a challenge that this won't be an issue.
        </p>
        <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
        <p>
          My biggest non-technical challenge will almost certainly be staying patient with my peers. Some students will no doubt pick things up faster than me but there are also likely to be students that take longer to figure things out which I can find extremely frustrating. It's a work-on of mine to be kind and patient with others in this scenario.
        </p>
        <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
        <p>
          I'd like to get in the habit of seeking feedback and collaboration with others earlier in my process instead of right at the end. It doesn't ALWAYS lead to a better outcome, but it MIGHT lead to a better outcome and that's something I'd like to take advantage of.
        </p>
        <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
        <p>
          I expect the bootcamp team to demand really high standards from me. I want to be encouraged for doing well but to also be pushed to extend myself outside my comfort zone.
        </p>
        <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
        <p>
          I expect to immerse myself in the bootcamp so that it becomes the dominant activity in my day to day life. This means that every activity is seen through the lens of 'how will this impact my bootcamp experience'. For example, an activity like exercising which I might usually do for fun can be justified as a way to ensure I get good sleep for bootcamp. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a person who needs downtime away from people to stay energised so I'm hoping to be able to maintain a 'workday' that finishes reasonably early in the evening so that I can spend time unwinding and relaxing after dinner. 
        </p>
        <h3>Personal Goals</h3>
        <p>
          I'd like to come out of this bootcamp with at least one interesting personal project that I'd be proud to show my friends or potentially future employers. It doesn't have to be finished, but I would like it to be something creative that showcases what I can do. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2 class="orbitron borderBottom">Foundations</h2>
        <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>
          My plan is to find a job as a junior/intermediate developer and gain
          experience in a reasonably mature tech/SaaS company. Eventually I hope
          to come up with some ideas / products to develop personally both as a
          hobby and as a secondary source of income.
        </p>

        <h3>
          What are your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I am confident that I can learn and understand anything if I'm given
          the time to think it through. I struggle if information is dumped on
          me in no particular order or without structure and I don't like
          learning things before they are relevant to me. If I'm asked to do
          something myself and given some kind of starting point, I usually
          figure things out on my own pretty quickly.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I would like to get better at sharing my work/processes with other
          people and to seek feedback earlier and more often. I have a tendancy
          to isolate myself until I think everything is perfect before sharing
          my work with others.
        </p>

        <h3>How will you manage your workload in this programme?</h3>
        <p>
          I expect to have no issues managing my workload for this programme. I
          have no dependents and a supportive partner who is ready to leave me
          to my own devices as required over the coming weeks/months. I intend
          to strictly enforce some periods of 'downtime' in the late evenings
          and weekends to prevent myself from burning out.
        </p>
        <p>
          If things become stressful, I always know I can straighten things out
          by doing some exercise. I have years of elite sports experience to
          fall back on here.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I find myself stuck on something for more than an hour I intend to
          seek help from my Facilitator or a peer who I consider knowledgeable.
        </p>
        <h3>What do you expect from the Facilitation team?</h3>
        <p>
          The main thing I'm expecting from the Facilitation team is for
          feedback and encouragement to push myself. I aim for excellence in all
          things so I will not be upset to have mistakes pointed out or to be
          given suggestions on how I can make something even better.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Is there any scheduling information such as block-out times when you
          are committed to other things?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I hope to maintain a weekly hobby night that I host with some friends
          on Thursday evenings however I will be willing to give this up during
          bootcamp if the workload makes this untenable.
