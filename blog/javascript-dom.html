      <h1>Javascript Fundamentals</h1>
      <h2>Javascript vs HTML vs CSS</h2>
      <p>
        A modern webpage is (usually) written using three separate programing
        languages/frameworks. HTML is used to define the content of the page,
        CSS is used to define the layout and visual appearance, but it's
        Javascript that is the secret sauce which transforms a webpage from a
        static document to the kind of dynamic and interactive digital media
        we're accustomed to. If loading a website was like putting together a
        model aeroplane, HTML would be the list of pieces you get in the box,
        CSS would be the instructions on how all the pieces fit together to make
        it look like a plane, and Javascript would be a bunch of electronics you
        could install to make it go
        <em><b>NYEEEOOM</b></em>
        when you fly it around your room
      </p>
      <p>
        Much like our model plane, the sky is the limit with Javascript in terms
        of what you can build given enough effort. However you can achieve a lot
        just by mastering some of the fundamentals outlined below
      </p>
      <h3>Control Flow</h3>
      <p>
        Control flow refers to the order in which a computer progam carries out
        all of the instructions it has been given. Most of the time a program
        will run one line after another in the order in which they're written.
        But what if we want to make our program do something different depending
        on what has happened beforehand? To make a useful program, we need a way
        for our code to make decisions about what to do. One option is to use an
        <b>if/else</b> statement.
      </p>
      <p class="codeBlock">
        <span style="color: cornflowerblue"
          >// How to respond when the empty light in your car comes on</span
        ><br />
        <span class="tag">if (</span> petrolLightIsOn
        <span class="tag">) {<br />&emsp; return</span>
        pretendNotToNotice()<br />&emsp; <span class="tag">console.log(</span>"I
        hope my wife goes to the petrol station soon..."<span class="tag"
          >)</span
        ><br />
        <span class="tag">} else {<br />&emsp; return</span>
        keepOnDriving()<br />
        <span class="tag">}</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        An if/else statement works a bit like it sounds. If some condition is
        met (e.g. the petrol light is on) then execute a particular command
        (e.g. just kinda ignore it...). Otherwise, execute some other command.
        With enough <b>ifs</b> and <b>elses</b> you can break down pretty much
        any complex decision
      </p>
      <h3>Loops</h3>
      <p>
        One of the best things about computers is that they never complain about
        doing the same thing over and over again. Repeating a simple operation
        over and over again is a common occurence in computer programming and it
        is usually achieved with <b>loops</b>
      </p>
      <p class="codeBlock">
        <span class="tag"> for ( let</span> i=1, i&ltdirtyDishes.length,
        i++<span class="tag"
          >) {<br />
          &emsp;let</span
        >
        dish = dirtyDishes[i]<br />
        <span class="tag">&emsp;let</span> cleanDish = scrub(dish)<br />
        <span class="tag"></span>&emsp;dishRack.push(cleanDish)<br />
        <span class="tag">}</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        The loop above is doing something we all wish we could ask a robot to do: Clean the dishes. The syntax of a loop can be confusing at first glance, but all its
        really saying is:
      <ul>
          <li>Start counting here:&emsp; <b>1</b></li>
          <li>Keep counting until you get here:&emsp; <span><b>The number of things in the dirtyDishes array</b></span></li>
          <li>Every time you finish the task below update the count:&emsp; <b>Increase by 1</b></li>
      </ul>
      So in real world terms, Starting with the first dirty dish, it takes the dish from the dirty pile (an array), scrubs the dish, then puts it in the clean pile (another array). It reapeats this for one dish one at a time until all the dirty dishes are clean.
      </p>
      <h3>Arrays vs Objects</h3>
      <p>Arrays and Objects are both used to store information that our program might need, but do so in different ways. An Array is a bit like a bucket. It is a generic container that you can put pretty much anything into, either for storage or to keep things organised. Unlike a bucket however, everyhing that goes into an Array is assigned a position (index) so that we can easily retrieve items from it.</p>
      <p class="codeBlock"><span style="color: cornflowerblue">//An array containing some of my favourite extraterrestial satellites</span><br>&emsp;<span class="tag">let</span> moons = ['Phobos', 'Deimos', 'Europa', 'Ganymede']</p>
      <p>An Object is also a container for information, but each entry exists as a combination if a <b>name</b> and a <b>value</b>. Its a bit like an ID card which lists various attributes or features about the thing it represents</p>
      <p class="codeBlock"><span style="color: cornflowerblue">//An object which stores some interesting moon properites </span><br><span class="tag">let</span> deimos = {<br>
      &emsp;orbitsPlanet: "Mars",<br>
      &emsp;radiusKm: 6.27 ,<br>
      &emsp;craters: ["Voltaire","Swift"],<br>
      }</p>
