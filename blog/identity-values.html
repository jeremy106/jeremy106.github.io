      <h1>Identity, Values, and Strengths</h1>
      <h2>
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I have had a priviledged upbringing with many opportunities. I was
        taught (by example) by my family to be generous and kind and to try to
        use what talents I have to do something positive in the world.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I have an unshakable confidence in my ability to figure things out. I
        expect to be able to learn a lot of the technical skills in this
        programme reasonably quickly and have plenty of bandwidth to absorb
        challenging material and develop my Core/Human skills.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes impatient with others that aren't keeping up. I expect
        everyone else to maintain the same standards as me. This can sometimes
        lead to frustration and grumpiness.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.
      </h2>
      <p>
        A non-technical colleague wanted to approach a data problem (my area of
        expertise at the time) in a way that I was convinced would not work as
        desired. Despite my protests, they insisted it would work and that I try
        it. My strategy at the time was to try to explain why it wouldn't work
        however it seemed that my colleague was either unable, or unwilling, to
        understand the issue. Eventually I relented, attempted to implement
        their suggested approach. I ended up spending a bunch of time on the
        project and ending up with a an result which (unsurprisingly) didn't
        suit our needs. When I showed it to my colleague they quickly realised
        the problem abandoned the project. While this only cost me a day's work,
        it was still a frustrating waste of time. I found it hard to justify
        taking a tougher stance in the beginning. Not sure how I'd approach this
        situation differently in the future. I suppose it depends whether I
        value my time/resources over potential confrontation/conflict with my
        colleagues.
