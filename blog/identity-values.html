        <h1>Identity, Values, and Strengths</h1>
        <h2>
          Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
          your values and identity.
        </h2>
        <p>
          I have had a priviledged upbringing with many opportunities. I was
          taught (by example) by my family to be generous and kind and to try to
          use what talents I have to do something positive in the world.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.
        </h2>
        <p>
          I have an unshakable confidence in my ability to figure things out. I
          expect to be able to learn a lot of the technical skills in this
          programme reasonably quickly and have plenty of bandwidth to absorb
          challenging material and develop my Core/Human skills.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Sometimes impatient with others that aren't keeping up. I expect
          everyone else to maintain the same standards as me. This can sometimes
          lead to frustration and grumpiness.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.
        </h2>
        <p>
          A non-technical colleague wanted to approach a data problem (my area
          of expertise at the time) in a way that I was convinced would not work
          as desired. Despite my protests, they insisted it would work and that
          I try it. My strategy at the time was to try to explain why it
          wouldn't work however it seemed that my colleague was either unable,
          or unwilling, to understand the issue. Eventually I relented,
          attempted to implement their suggested approach. I ended up spending a
          bunch of time on the project and ending up with a an result which
          (unsurprisingly) didn't suit our needs. When I showed it to my
          colleague they quickly realised the problem abandoned the project.
          While this only cost me a day's work, it was still a frustrating waste
          of time. I found it hard to justify taking a tougher stance in the
          beginning. Not sure how I'd approach this situation differently in the
          future. I suppose it depends whether I value my time/resources over
          potential confrontation/conflict with my colleagues.
