      <h1>Positioning in CSS</h1>
      <h2>
        What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed
        positioning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        An html document is made up of many elements. In fact, pretty much all
        of the content on the page is an element of some kind. For example each
        image, block of text, button etc. When the page is loaded by your
        browser, each element is put on the screen one after the other, in the
        order in which it appears in the document.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each new element will either appear below the previous element on a new
        line (Block-Level) or next to the previous element on the same line
        (Inline). If no other positioning rules are applied, then the position
        of the element is <b>Static</b> and the element will simply show up on
        the screen according to its place amongst the other elements in the
        document. If we want to move the element around on the screen we fisrt
        choose whether the positioning will be <b>Relative</b>, <b>Absolute</b>,
        or <b>Fixed</b>.
      </p>

        src="../images/css-position-diagram.jpg"
        alt="css-position-diagram"
        class="mainImage"
      />
      <p>
        <b>Relative</b> positioning uses the natural (static) position as a
        starting point and then moves the element from there. It can be moved
        any distance in any direction (i.e. up, down, left, or right) on the
        page but all these movements are all measured from wherever the element
        started its life on the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Absolute</b> positioning might be the easiest to understand. It lets
        you put an element in a specific place in the document, such as the very
        top left corner, or 100 pixels from the left hand side etc. Think of it
        like gluing a cutout or photo onto a piece of paper. As you scroll up
        and down, the image will move with the rest of the page
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Fixed</b> positioning places an element at a certain place on your
        viewport (screen). Its a bit bit like putting a sticky note on your
        computer monitor in that when you scroll up and down, the rest of the
        page will move but the sticky note just stays where it is.
