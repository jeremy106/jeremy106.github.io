        <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>
          Emotional Intelligence (EQ) measures a person's ability to perceive,
          understand, and control emotional responses in themself and in others.
          An EQ score is measured by having someone answer questions or perform
          tasks related to their own feelings, thoughts, or behaviours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Assessments can be self-reported questionaires such as the
          <a href="https://eiconsortium.org/measures/msceit.html"
            ><b
              >The Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT)</b
            ></a
          >, but can also involve having someone who knows the person well
          answer questions about them from an outside perspective such as the
          <a href="https://www.eiconsortium.org/pdf/ESCI_user_guide.pdf"
            ><b>Emotional and Social Competence Inventory (ESCI)</b></a
          >. Deliberate practice has been shown to improve EQ scores sugggesting
          that it is a skill that can be developed over time rather that a trait
          you are born with or without.
        </p>
        <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
        <p>
          Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is a system of tests designed to assess
          someones mental ability to solve problems, recognise patterns, retain
          information etc. Generally these skills are externally focussed and
          involve understanding or interacting with the enironment. EQ on the
          other hand is more internally focussed and focusses on a persons inner
          thoughts and responses to the world and other people. High scores in
          IQ and EQ have both been shown to predict positive outcomes in the
          lives of those individuals.
        </p>
        <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
        <p>
          Emotional intelligence improves a person's ability to work in teams,
          handle stressful situations, and promotes a general sense of
          well-being. Many businesses are beginning to prioritise EQ over IQ
          when hiring, especially for people in leadership positions. If IQ were
          the power of racecar's engine or the how well it handles on the
          corners, EQ would represent the focus and decision-making of the
          driver. You need both if you want to win the race.
